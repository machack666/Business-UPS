Description:

 * FOR SHIPPING COST INFO:
    This module requires input of the shipping method, origin zip code, 
      destination zip code, and weight of the package. It then connects to
      the UPS calculation server and outputs the total shipping charges and
      the UPS zone.

    It's a very simplified way of finding shipping costs based on the "Quick
    Cost Calculator" document found on the UPS Website at
      http://www.ups.com/tools/tools.html

 * FOR TRACKING PACKAGES:
    It's an interface to submit a tracking number to the UPS web site
      and parse the output and return a hash with the appropriate values.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	NOTICE: U.P.S. _REQUIRES_ the display of the "Notice" key if the
		hash returned when displaying UPS tracking information.
		It is as follows:
	-------------------------
	"UPS authorizes you to use UPS tracking systems solely to track
	shipments tendered by or for you to UPS for delivery and for
	no other purpose. Any other use of UPS tracking systems and
	information is strictly prohibited."
